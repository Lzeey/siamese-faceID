# faceID in PyTorch

Re-implementation of FaceID in pytorch. Original idea based off <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-implemented-iphone-xs-faceid-using-deep-learning-in-python-d5dbaa128e1d">link</a>.

The .py file is created automatically from the notebook file, so you could find a strange ordering of code and functions. I **highly suggest to use the notebook version**.
